___

Programming language | Natural Language
---|---
specific | more general
a limited set of allowed elements | rich vocab, thousands of words
definite single meaning | ambiguous
consistent over time | changes over time

___

> **Fundamental computer operation** - simple one instruction operation\
> **Compound computer operation** = operation that requires more than one operation

___

Machine code | Low Level P.L. | High Level P.L.
---|---|---
consists of ones and zeroes | theoretically human-readable, but still hard to understand | easy to use for humans, sometimes can be understood even by a non-programmer
understood by the computer | mostly fundamental operations | mostly compound operations

## High Level Programming Languages
### Pros:
1) easier to learn & understand
2) faster to write
3) more general in terms of machine that can run it
4) give more safety guarantees

### Cons:
1) need more computer resources
2) slower runtime
   
## Low Level Programming Languages
### Pros:
1) easier to *translate* into machine code
2) can be more optimized for running of the program
3) faster runtime
4) give more control over computer
### Cons:
1) machine specific, not cross-platform between systems or architectures
2) easier to make an error, less safe
3) harder to understand & write

___

> **Syntax** - is all the rules of what our code should look like.\
> **Semantics** - is the results a given piece of code produces and calculations that are made.
